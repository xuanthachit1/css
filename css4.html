            The head is deep blue with a greenish-yellow nuchal collar and the rest of the upper parts(wings, back and tail) are deep green.
            The chest is red  with blue-black baring.
            The belly is deep green, and the things and rump are yellow with deep green barring.
            In flight a yellow wing-bar contrasts clearly with the red underwing coverts.

            There is little to visually distinguish between the sexes; however, to a keen observer of their colouring and behaviour,their dimorphism id readily apparent.
